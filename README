Customizable, can choose between 1, 10, or 20 of AO, Long, or waveform (array) standard named records and can choose element size of array records.
For standard waveform records element number and field type default to 500 and DOUBLE if not specified.

Can also create custom record names with the choices of the above record types, but must be created on individual lines in the cfg file.

SPECIAL(PV=AMO:CB:TEST,RECTYPE=waveform,NELM=600,FTYPE=DOUBLE)
